# **`WHAT I LEARNED IN WEEK`**


### **`Keyboard Shortcuts`**

        *We started Web Development class by learning useful key board shortcuts that will help us to make fast changes without even using the mouse.* 


        * Some useful shortcuts:
        * `Command + space` = search bar
        * `Control + left/right` = Switch the screen left/right
        * `Control + up` = 
        * `Command + K` = search menu in slack

### **`Terminal`**

    *After learning some short cuts, we started to learn **Terminal**, which is a great tool to control your computer by using a command line. You open, delete, move, change, add and make many more changes to the files on your computer by using command line.*

    * Bash is the language we use in Terminal. It is the most common command line.

      * Some useful terminology:
      * `pwd` = Where am I?
      * `~` = home
      * `ls` = list of everything in where you at
      * `cd` = change directory 
      * `mkdir` =make a directory
      * `rm` = remove
      * `touch` = create a file
      * `mv` = move files

### **`GitHub`**

    * We first learned about `GitHub`, which is a website for hosting projects that use Git. 
    * GitHub is like a social media for coders. Coders can collaborate and edit other's projects.* 

### **`Git`**

    * Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes to files.

    * The purpose of Git is to organize the work into list of changes. We can use Git to see what changes have been made to the file and by who did the changes.

    * Multiple people can collaborate on a single project and it is possible to track everyone's progress and contribution. 

    * One of the most interesting fact about Git is that Linus Torvalds created Git so that he won't have to pay for his system, and I don't blame him! :)


    * Important steps of Git:
    * `Git init` : initializes the repository
    * `git add` : adds changes in the file
    * `git status` : tells which changes have been made
    * `git commit -m` : commits the changes into repository
    * `git clone` : downloads the repository to our computer
    * `git push -u origin master` : pushes the changes to the repository

### **`Visual Studio Code`**

    * Visual Studio Code is a code editor for coders.
    * We are using VS Code to do our first assignment :) 
    * There are some important shortcuts for VS Code. Here are some we have learned today:
    
        * `Shift-left/right` = selects as you move with the arrow
        * `Command-D` = selects entire word
        * `Option-up arrow` = moves the line up
        * `Option- down arrow` = moves the line down 
        * `Command-right arrow`=move to end of the line.
        * `Command-left arrow` = move to the beginning of the line.

### **`Markdown`**

    * Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for coders. 
    * Markdown is markup language with plain text formatting syntax..
    * It is convenient and easy for coders compared to HTML.
    * It can be used for:
    * Email
    * Presentation
    * Notes
    * Documents
    * `.md` is used as a file extension
