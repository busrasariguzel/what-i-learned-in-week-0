# **WHAT I LEARNED IN WEEK 0**


### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

*We started Web Development class by learning useful key board shortcuts that will help us to make fast changes without even using the mouse.* 

* Some useful shortcuts:
  * `Command + space` = search bar
  * `Control + left/right` = Switch the screen left/right
  * `Control + up` = 
  * `Command + K` = search menu in slack

### **Terminal**

*After learning some short cuts, we started to learn **Terminal**, which is a great tool to open, delete, create, move folders and files on your computer by using command line.*

* Some useful terminology:
    * `pwd` = Where am I?
    * `~` = home
    * `ls` = list of everything in where you at
    * `cd` = change directory 
    * `mkdir` =make a directory
    * `rm` = remove
    * `touch` = create a file
    * `mv` = move files

### **GitHub**

*We first learned about **GitHub**, which is a social media for coders. Coders can collaborate and show their projects to each other, and edit other's projects.*

### **Git**

*One of the most interesting fact about Git is that Linus Torvalds created Git so that he won't have to pay for his system, and I don't blame him!*

* The purpose of Git is to organize the work into list of changes. 

* Important steps of Git
    * `Git init` : initializes the repository
    * `git add` : adds changes in the file
    * `git status` : tells which changes have been made
    * `git commit -m` : commits the changes into repository
    * `git push -u origin master` : pushes the changes to the repository

### **Visual Studio Code**

* VS Code is a code editor
* We are using VS Code to do our first assignment :) 
* There are some important shortcuts for VS Code. Here are some we learned today:
    * Shift-left/right = selects as you move with the arrow
    * Command-D = selects entire word
    * Option-up arrow = moves the line up
    * option- down arrow =moves the line down
